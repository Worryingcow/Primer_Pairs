hello. 

this is the repository for a streamlit app that finds primer pair combinations give a list of forward and reverse primer. 
The code also is able to handle primers to be excluded from the list (for instance if those primers have already been used)

The only thing you should need to look at if you want to use the app is the Excel_formating_requirements folder in order to see the 
formating of the excel files

Happy sequencing
